# Hello_world_I_guess
Hi, I'm just getting started with github, checking how everything works and stuff.
I mainly want to learn to use it, the hows, the whys, etc...

I **reallyyy** don't know if I will keep being active here but since it was something required to use visual studio code I figured i just give it a shot.

Here are some random Syntax to get the idea

`delete("System32")`[^1]

[^1]: This is good to put as a way to stop your program in case it gives an error.[^2]
[^2]: I am lying.
